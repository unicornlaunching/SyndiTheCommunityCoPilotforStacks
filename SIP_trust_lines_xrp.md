## Logical Relationships Summary

### Propositional Logic in Practice
- IF (sunny) THEN (photosynthesize)
- IF (dry) AND (mature) THEN (water)

### Predicate Logic in Practice
- ∀plant(NeedsWater(plant))
- ∃location(OptimalGrowth(location))

### Modal Logic in Practice
- □(ValidStructure)
- ◇(UserInteraction)

## Conclusion

By understanding these logical concepts through the garden metaphor, we can:
1. Build more maintainable applications
2. Create clearer mental models
3. Better understand system relationships
4. Implement more robust solutions

Remember:
- Logic is our foundation (soil)
- Structure is our framework (garden layout)
- Behavior is our life cycle (growth and maintenance)
- State is our condition (garden health)
