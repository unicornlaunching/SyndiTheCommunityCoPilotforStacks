# Trust Lines on XRP Explained Like I'm 5

## The Piggy Bank Example 🐷

Imagine you have a special piggy bank. But this isn't just any piggy bank - it's a magical one that can only accept money from people you trust.

## How It Works 🎮

1. **Making Friends**
- First, you tell your piggy bank "I trust my friend Sarah"
- Now Sarah can put money in your piggy bank
- But random strangers can't!

2. **Setting Limits**
- You can tell your piggy bank "I trust Sarah up to $20"
- This means Sarah can't put more than $20 in your piggy bank
- It's like having a safety lock!

3. **Two-Way Trust**
- If Sarah also trusts you with her piggy bank
- You can both share money back and forth
- But only up to the amounts you each set

## Why It's Important 🛡️

- Keeps bad guys from putting fake money in your piggy bank
- Stops strangers from sending you things you don't want
- Lets you control who can interact with your money

## Real World Example 🌍

It's like having a mailbox that:
- Only accepts letters from friends you know
- Won't let spam mail in
- Has a special lock that only your trusted friends have the key to

## Safety First 🔒

Just like your parents tell you "don't take candy from strangers", trust lines tell your digital piggy bank "don't take tokens from strangers!"

Remember: In the digital world, it's important to choose carefully who you trust with your piggy bank! 🐷✨
